# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
The Brain Stroke Prediction dataset is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle for people to interact with and test different prediction techniques on, to build a robust prediction model.

This is a small project I built to apply the concepts of data pre-processing, data visualization and prediction model building learnt in the subject of Machine Learning taught in my university.
The model uses Seaborn and Pyplot for the purpose of data visualization. 2 prediction models have been built using the KNN and SVM methodologies.
